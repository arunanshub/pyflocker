"""The `ciphers` package
This package provides:
    - wrappers for cryptographic primitives to add support for
      encrypting/decrypting files and file streams
    - base classes to implement new wrappers
      (available in `pyflocker.ciphers.base`)
All cipher implementations are stored here in their own modules.
Read their documentation to learn more.
