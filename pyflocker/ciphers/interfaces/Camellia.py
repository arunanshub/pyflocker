    """Instantiate a new Camellia cipher wrapper object.

    Args:
        encrypting (bool):
            True is encryption and False is decryption.
        key (bytes, bytearray, memoryview):
            The key for the cipher.
        mode (:class:`pyflocker.ciphers.modes.Modes`):
            The mode to use for Camellia cipher. All backends may not support
            that particular mode.
        iv_or_nonce (bytes, bytearray, memoryview):
            The Initialization Vector or Nonce for the cipher. It must not be
            repeated with the same key.

    Keyword Arguments:
        use_hmac (bool):
            Should the cipher use HMAC as authentication or not.
            (Default: ``False``)
        tag_length (int, None):
            Length of HMAC tag. By default, a **16 byte tag** is generated. If
            ``tag_length`` is ``None``, a **non-truncated** tag is generated.
            Length of non-truncated tag depends on the digest size of the
            underlying hash algorithm used by HMAC.
        digestmod (str, BaseHash):
            The algorithm to use for HMAC. Defaults to ``sha256``.
            Specifying this value without setting ``use_hmac`` to True
            has no effect.
        file (filelike):
            The source file to read from. If ``file`` is specified
            and the ``mode`` is not an AEAD mode, HMAC is always used.
        backend (:class:`pyflocker.ciphers.backends.Backends`):
            The backend to use. It must be a value from :any:`Backends`.

    Important:
        The following arguments are ignored if the mode is an AEAD mode:

        - ``use_hmac``
        - ``tag_length``
        - ``digestmod``

    Returns:
        BaseSymmetricCipher:
            Camellia cipher from the appropriate backend module.

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: if backend does not support that mode.
        UnsupportedAlgorithm: if the backend does not support Camellia.

    Note:
        Any other error that is raised is from the backend itself.
